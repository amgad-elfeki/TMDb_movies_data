<b>Project Overview</b>

In this project, we have a dataset of 10,000 movies from TMDb that were created between 1969 and 2015.
We will analyze the data then communicate the findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib in our analysis process.

<b>Why this Project?</b>

I made this project during my Nanodegree Program on Udacity in coordination with the Ministry of Communication & Information Technology in Egypt.
<br>I will be done with the program by the end of January 2021, and there will be more projects to submit and learn from.

<b>How this project contributed to my skills?</b>

After completing the project, I have learned the following:
<br>- Got familiar with all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
<br>- Became comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
<br>- Got to know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
<br>- Getting experience communicating the results of my analysis
<br>- Became able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up the data analysis code
<br>- Became familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access the data more conveniently
<br>- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
